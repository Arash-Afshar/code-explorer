# Code Explorer

**This is mostly AI generated code, do not trust any of it without careful code review!**

The goal of this repo is provide a demo of how a search-like interface can be built to search through code and pdf documentation for a repository like [coinbase/cb-mpc](github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc).

## Phase 1
In the first phase, you can upload the pdfs and parse them so that it is searchable by llms. The following demo shows how it can be used to search through the file content.



## Phase 2
TODO: In the second phase you can also search the code.
